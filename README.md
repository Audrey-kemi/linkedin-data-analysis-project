## **Insights and Findings**

#### **In Demand Jobs:**
From the analysis, we found that the top 2 Job roles, which accounted for 11% and 10% of the total job postings, respectively, were Lead Java Software Engineer, and Senior Automation Tester. In contrast, the total number of applications submitted for these roles was significantly low. The niche nature or specialized qualifications requirements of this role may limit the number of applicants.   Inversely, the Business Analyst role, which accounts for 7% of the total job postings, received the most number of applications (18,000+). This gives insights into the extremely competitive nature of this role.
  We suggest that the career services department should create customized skill development programs that align with the specific job opportunities in demand. These programs should focus on teaching students the exact skills, certifications, and qualifications that are sought after by employers for these roles.

#### **Work Style Adoption:**
The analysis reveals a dynamic job market with an almost equal number of remote and on-site job postings, indicating that companies are exploring flexible work arrangements. Highly sought-after roles increasingly offer remote work options, except for business analysts who often require in-person collaboration.
Company Size is crucial because larger companies offer more remote work opportunities,Â and this highlights resource and infrastructure disparities.
   Our recommendation is to stay open to diverse work styles, as flexibility is key, and for in-demand roles with remote options, focus on strong time management and communication skills. Consideration should be given to the company size that aligns with your career goals, with larger companies offering more remote positions. Career Services at Universities should prepare students for this evolving landscape, emphasizing skills like remote communication and adaptability.
